Though governments have taken different measures to control the spread of COVID-19, it seems that the reported cases of COVID-19 still remain high in many places. In this project, we’re interested in the worldwide COVID-19 virus and vaccination data. This project aims at exploring the distribution of worldwide COVID-19 data from time and space dimensions. Specifically, we’ll take a look at the daily reported and death COVID-19 cases of different countries. From this part, we want to find out the spread path of COVID-19 and the characteristic of heavily infected countries. Also, we’ll look at the vaccination data and explore whether vaccination is effective on reducing reported or death COVID-19 cases. Our research will provide a grand view of worldwide COVID-19 situation. Hopefully, we’ll also provide some insights of whether vaccination is an effective way to control the spread of COVID-19. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research Topics 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research Topics The final project targets to analyze and visualize the distribution of COVID-19 from different aspects, including how fatality varies around the globe, how the virus spreads out, when and how the variants transform and lead to long-lasting damage, and how recent daily/weekly cases fluctuate. Throughout these three years, COVID-19 has severely outbroken and struck the globe, paralyzed our economies and daily lives, and even transformed into different variants leading to continuing catastrophes. In this project, we are dedicated to taking advantage of different visualization tools and techniques from lectures to presenting how COVID-19 affects our globe in these years and digging into deeper insights into why the virus varies from time to time and from country to country. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard On the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard website, there are four datasets opened to be downloaded.

Here are the description of them. Our data are downloaded from the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard website on Dec. 13, 2022. 3.1.1 Daily cases and deaths by date reported to WHO This data set is designed to show the spread of covid-19 virus in countries, territories, and areas around the world from January 2020 to the present (It should be noticed that in our project we get records until Dec. 13, 2022). It contains 8 columns, whose detail descriptions are shown below. Field name Type Description Date_reported Date Date of reporting to WHO Country_code String ISO Alpha-2 country code Country String Country, territory, area WHO_region String WHO regional offices: WHO Member States are grouped into six WHO regions – Regional Office for Africa (AFRO), Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO), Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO), Regional Office for Europe (EURO), Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO), and Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO). New_cases Integer New confirmed cases. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative case count from current cumulative cases count.* Cumulative_cases Integer Cumulative confirmed cases reported to WHO to date. New_deaths Integer New confirmed deaths. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative deaths from current cumulative deaths.* Cumulative_deaths Integer Cumulative confirmed deaths reported to WHO to date. daily_case &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;./data/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv&quot;) # Brief view of the data. head(daily_case) ## Date_reported Country_code Country WHO_region New_cases Cumulative_cases ## 1 2020-01-03 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 ## 2 2020-01-04 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 ## 3 2020-01-05 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 ## 4 2020-01-06 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 ## 5 2020-01-07 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 ## 6 2020-01-08 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 ## New_deaths Cumulative_deaths ## 1 0 0 ## 2 0 0 ## 3 0 0 ## 4 0 0 ## 5 0 0 ## 6 0 0 # See the number of countries, territories, and areas. cat(&quot;The number of conuntries, territories, and areas recorded: &quot;,length(unique(daily_case$Country))) ## The number of conuntries, territories, and areas recorded: 237 # See the beginning date and ending date of the records. print(paste0(&quot;The last day of records: &quot;, max(as.Date(daily_case$Date_reported)))) print(paste0(&quot;The first day of records: &quot;, min(as.Date(daily_case$Date_reported)))) ## [1] &quot;The last day of records: 2022-12-13&quot; ## [1] &quot;The first day of records: 2020-01-03&quot; According to the brief view of the data, it is tidy, which means that: Every column is a variable. Every row is an observation. Every cell is a single value. It contains daily information of 237 countries, territories, and areas from 2020-01-03 to 2022-12-13. 3.1.2 Latest reported counts of cases and deaths Different from the data set of daily cases and deaths, this data set focus on the reported cases and deaths in the recent period (recent 7 days, and recent 24 hours). It contains 12 columns, and here are the descriptions of them. Field name Type Description Name String Country, territory, area WHO_region String WHO Region Cases - cumulative total Integer Cumulative confirmed cases reported to WHO to date. Cases - cumulative total per 100000 population Decimal Cumulative confirmed cases reported to WHO to date per 100,000 population.

Since it focuses on the recent cases, there is no column about the record date. Another thing that should be noticed is that the number of countries, territories, and areas is different from the last data set. 3.1.3 Vaccination data This data set shows the vaccination status of covid-19 in different countries, territories, and areas.

However, in the next chapter, we need use monthly information. Therefore, we create a monthly reported cases and deaths data set from the WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv. library(lubridate) library(tidyverse) library(redav) daily_case$month = format(as.Date(daily_case$Date_reported, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;), &quot;%y-%m&quot;) month_case &lt;- daily_case %&gt;% group_by(WHO_region, Country_code, Country, month) %&gt;% summarize( New_cases = sum(New_cases), New_deaths = sum(New_deaths), Cumulative_cases = max(Cumulative_cases), Cumulative_deaths = max(Cumulative_deaths), ) write.csv(month_case, file = &quot;./data/monthly_data.csv&quot;) 3.3 Missing value analysis daily_case_na = sum(is.na(daily_case)) reccent_case_na = sum(is.na(reccent_case)) vcc_na = sum(is.na(vcc)) vcc_meta_na = sum(is.na(vcc_meta)) print(paste0(&quot;The number of missing values in daily reported and death data set: &quot;, daily_case_na)) print(paste0(&quot;The number of missing values in reccent reported and death data set: &quot;, reccent_case_na)) print(paste0(&quot;The number of missing values in vaccination data set: &quot;, vcc_na)) print(paste0(&quot;The number of missing values in vaccination meat-data set: &quot;, vcc_meta_na)) ## [1] &quot;The number of missing values in daily reported and death data set: 1076&quot; ## [1] &quot;The number of missing values in reccent reported and death data set: 242&quot; ## [1] &quot;The number of missing values in vaccination data set: 55&quot; ## [1] &quot;The number of missing values in vaccination meat-data set: 2142&quot; Basically, vaccination meta-data set has the most missing values. plot_missing(month_case, percent = FALSE) There is only some country codes missing in WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv, because some member of WHO are not a country. Those missing values will not influence our exploration. plot_missing(reccent_case, percent = FALSE) Most of the missing values belong to Deaths...newly.report. This is because some countries have no reccent deaths or do not care about covid-19 anymore. Those missing values will not influence our exploration. plot_missing(vcc, percent = FALSE) The data of most rows in vaccination-data.csv are complete. plot_missing(vcc_meta, percent = FALSE) All of the values of END_DATE and COMMENT are missing, but since we do not analysis text data, those missing values will not influence our exploration. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Abstract 4.2 A brief look at the spread of Covid-19 and Vaccinations 4.3 Do vaccinations really work? 4.4 Dive into Vaccinations", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Abstract In this chapter, we use exploration data analysis to answer the questions that we proposed in the proposal chapter. This chapter is divided into three parts. In the first part we apply line plot, treemap, and Cleveland dot plot to brief visualize the spread and death cases of Covid-19. We find that at this stage of omicron variant of Covid-19, it is difficult and no efficient to completely prevent the spread of it. Thus, we have to learn how to live with Covid-19. Meanwhile, some areas still lack vaccines. In the second part, we use mosiac plot and split bar chart to determine whether vaccinations can prevent the spread of Covid-19. It is astonishing that vaccines do not work in preventing the spread of Covid-19. Fortunately, our result shows that vaccines do reduce the death rate in all regions. In the last part, we dive into vaccination details by scatter plot and box plot. The result shows that we’d better be fully vaccinated and even be vaccinated with a booster. 4.2 A brief look at the spread of Covid-19 and Vaccinations First, we use line plot to visualize the monthly new reported and cumulative cases and deaths group by WHO_region. # trend of different region month_df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/monthly_data.csv&quot;) temp_df &lt;- month_df %&gt;% group_by(WHO_region, month) %&gt;% summarise( New_cases = sum(New_cases), New_deaths = sum(New_deaths), Cumulative_cases = max(Cumulative_cases), Cumulative_deaths = max(Cumulative_deaths), ) ggplot(temp_df, aes(x=month, y=New_cases, group = WHO_region, color = WHO_region)) + geom_line()+geom_point()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))+ggtitle(&quot;Monthly Cases Reported&quot;) ggplot(temp_df, aes(x=month, y=Cumulative_cases, group = WHO_region, color = WHO_region)) + geom_line()+geom_point()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))+ggtitle(&quot;Cumulative cases Every Month&quot;) Although there is no clear pattern in the number of new cases reported per WHO_region during the first two years of covid-19 spread, there is a clear spike in new cases in economically active and populous regions around December 2021. At this time it was the omicron variant that became the dominant virus, and it was difficult for humans to completely prevent this virus from spreading. Evidence of this is that areas with relatively conservative epidemic prevention policies (WPRO) have also seen a surge in cases. ggplot(temp_df, aes(x=month, y=New_deaths, group = WHO_region, color = WHO_region)) + geom_line()+geom_point()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))+ggtitle(&quot;Monthly &quot;)+ggtitle(&quot;Monthly Deaths Reported&quot;) ggplot(temp_df, aes(x=month, y=Cumulative_deaths, group = WHO_region, color = WHO_region)) + geom_line()+geom_point()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))+ggtitle(&quot;Cumulative Deaths Every Month&quot;) For a considerable period of time, two regions with relative lax policy about covid-19 led the world in the number of new deaths, while deaths in regions with more conservative epidemic prevention policies were kept at a consistently low level, suggesting that early isolation of infected populations does help to control the death toll. However, starting in 2022, the number of new deaths in each region reaches a lower range, suggesting that the “early detection, early isolation” is no longer a significant efficient method for new variants of the virus. Next, we show the cumulative cases of each countries, territories, and areas until 2022-12-13 with the help of Cleveland dot plot, and group them by WHO_region. # Extract the cumulative cases of the last day in the dataset daily_last = daily_case[daily_case$Date_reported == &quot;2022-12-13&quot;,] ggplot(daily_last, aes(x = Cumulative_cases, y = reorder(Country, Cumulative_cases))) + geom_point(color = &quot;blue&quot;) + facet_grid(WHO_region ~ ., scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, space = &quot;free_y&quot;) + ggtitle(&#39;Cumulative Cases in All Countries, Territories, and Areas&#39;) + xlab(&quot;Countries, Territories, and Areas&quot;) + ylab(&#39;Number of Cumulative Cases&#39;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) According to the Cleveland dot plot, Covid-19 seems prefer areas with high level of development in each WHO region, such as Republic of Korea and Japan in WPRO, France and Germany in EURO, South Africa in AFRO, etc.. This is because highly developed regions mean more intensive movement and communications of people and are more suitable for the spread of infectious diseases. Next, we want to dig deep into how death rate varies around the globe. Also, we want to include the infected population as one of the axis for better visualization on Covid-19 data. cases_country = daily_case[daily_case$Date_reported == &quot;2022-12-13&quot;, ] cases_country$death_rate = cases_country$Cumulative_deaths /cases_country$Cumulative_cases library(treemap) treemap::treemap(cases_country, index=c(&quot;WHO_region&quot;, &quot;ISO3&quot;), vSize=&quot;Cumulative_cases&quot;, vColor=&quot;death_rate&quot;, type=&quot;value&quot;, palette=&quot;RdYlBu&quot;, format.legend = list(scientific = FALSE, big.mark = &quot; &quot;)) The above treemap exhibits how death rates vary around the globe and include the infected population as one of the measurement. The countries are divided into six regions and packed into rectangles for better comparison among each region. The filled color represents how much is the death rate of each country since the start of Covid-19. We use diverging spectrum for presenting color for the sake of better glimpse of countries on the two extreme which high death rates or low ones. Also, we use yellow and blue for the two extremes since they are complementary color which are stronger enough for comparison for most people. As we can see from the map, Europe and Americas accounts for the major parts of infected population. Also, we can see how the death rate inequality happens in the region. For example, in Americas, Mexico, Peru and Ecuador has high death rates over 10 percentages while the majority of countries in Americas has death rate less than 3%. Likewise, we can see the similar inequality in Eastern Mediterranean and Europe. Last but not least, since that the infected population varies largely depends on the countries’ population. For those coutry with less population, it is highly likely that they would not be shown clearly on this graph. For example, Yemen has death rate up to 18 percentages but since its population (both national and infected ones) is much smaller than other countries, it cannot be shown clearly in treemap. In sum, this treemap give us a great summarization of how the death rates vary across country on the aspect of infected population but it also neglect those small countries in desperate needs of further aids in Covid-19 crises. Last, we reuse the Cleveland dot plot to show the vaccination status in different regions. vcc[vcc$WHO_REGION != &quot;OTHER&quot;,] %&gt;% select(COUNTRY, WHO_REGION, TOTAL_VACCINATIONS_PER100, PERSONS_VACCINATED_1PLUS_DOSE_PER100, PERSONS_FULLY_VACCINATED_PER100, PERSONS_BOOSTER_ADD_DOSE_PER100 ) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;type&quot;, value = &quot;percentage&quot;, TOTAL_VACCINATIONS_PER100, PERSONS_VACCINATED_1PLUS_DOSE_PER100, PERSONS_FULLY_VACCINATED_PER100, PERSONS_BOOSTER_ADD_DOSE_PER100) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = percentage, y = reorder(COUNTRY, type = &quot;TOTAL_VACCINATIONS_PER1OO&quot;, percentage, .desc=FALSE), color = type)) + facet_grid(WHO_REGION~., scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, space = &quot;free_y&quot;) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;Vaccinations in Different WHO_region&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Countries, Territories, and Areas&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Percentage&quot;) scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Spectral&quot;) ## &lt;ggproto object: Class ScaleDiscrete, Scale, gg&gt; ## aesthetics: fill ## axis_order: function ## break_info: function ## break_positions: function ## breaks: waiver ## call: call ## clone: function ## dimension: function ## drop: TRUE ## expand: waiver ## get_breaks: function ## get_breaks_minor: function ## get_labels: function ## get_limits: function ## guide: legend ## is_discrete: function ## is_empty: function ## labels: waiver ## limits: NULL ## make_sec_title: function ## make_title: function ## map: function ## map_df: function ## n.breaks.cache: NULL ## na.translate: TRUE ## na.value: NA ## name: waiver ## palette: function ## palette.cache: NULL ## position: left ## range: &lt;ggproto object: Class RangeDiscrete, Range, gg&gt; ## range: NULL ## reset: function ## train: function ## super: &lt;ggproto object: Class RangeDiscrete, Range, gg&gt; ## rescale: function ## reset: function ## scale_name: brewer ## train: function ## train_df: function ## transform: function ## transform_df: function ## super: &lt;ggproto object: Class ScaleDiscrete, Scale, gg&gt; Despite the fact that 3 years have passed since covid-19 was first identified, the majority of countries in all WHO regions still have fewer vaccinations than their total population, suggesting that there is still a shortage of vaccines all over the world. Meanwhile, there is a degree of inequity in the distribution of the vaccine for there are huge differences in vaccination status in each countries of the same WHO regions. In addition, African countries have the greatest vaccine shortage across all regions, with only six countries having more vaccinations than the total population. 4.3 Do vaccinations really work? First, we use vaccination-metadata.csv to get the vaccination starting date. If there are several starting date of a nation, we use the earliest date as the representative of the vaccination’s starting date of that nation since we do not have how the exact vaccination policies implement for each nation. In the meantime, since that we do not have how long will human bodies’ begin to work against Covid-19 after vaccination for each type of vaccine, we simply take the vaccination start date as the start date for immune system take effects. The reason that behind our decision is that, in most countries around the world, specialists and governments has propagated that people who received vaccines should stay at home and take good rests for few days in order not to suffer from severe side effects which makes them not exposed to virus and with low chances to be infected. Hence, we can use the vaccination start date to approximate the start date for immune system take effects. library(dplyr) library(tidyverse) # Data 1: WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv daily_case &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;./data/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv&quot;) # Change country code to ISO3 library(countrycode) daily_case$ISO3 = countryname(daily_case$Country, destination = &#39;iso3c&#39;) daily_case$Date_reported = as.Date(daily_case$Date_reported) # Data 2: vaccination-metadata.csv vac_metadata &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;./data/vaccination-metadata.csv&quot;) # Keep only before and after vac_metadata &lt;- vac_metadata[vac_metadata$START_DATE != &quot;&quot;, ] # Get vaccination EARLIEST start date for each country vac_start = vac_metadata %&gt;% group_by(ISO3) %&gt;% summarize(START_DATE = min(START_DATE)) vac_start$START_DATE = as.Date(vac_start$START_DATE) # Merge two df daily_case &lt;- merge(daily_case, vac_start, by=&quot;ISO3&quot;) Second, we use data/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv to calculate cumulative death cases before and after the vaccination start date for each country. Then, we can group by regions and generate the tidy data with each row containing region, vaccination indicator, case (alive or dead), and the count for case. tmp1 &lt;- daily_case %&gt;% group_by(WHO_region) %&gt;% summarize( death_bf_vac = sum(New_deaths[Date_reported &lt; START_DATE]), live_bf_vac = sum(New_cases[Date_reported &lt; START_DATE]) - sum(New_deaths[Date_reported &lt; START_DATE]), death_af_vac = sum(New_deaths[Date_reported &gt;= START_DATE]), live_af_vac = sum(New_cases[Date_reported &gt;= START_DATE]) - sum(New_deaths[Date_reported &gt;= START_DATE]), ) # TIDYDATA: REGION(cat) | VAC(cat) | CASE(cat) | COUNT(num) tidy &lt;- tmp1 %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = !WHO_region, names_to = &quot;Meta&quot;, values_to = &quot;Freq&quot;) library(stringr) tidy$Vaccination &lt;- ifelse(str_detect(tidy$Meta, &quot;af_vac&quot;), &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) tidy$Case &lt;- ifelse(str_detect(tidy$Meta, &quot;live&quot;), &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Died&quot;) tidy &lt;- subset(tidy, select = -c(Meta) ) # Mosaic plot by Region, vaccination and case library(vcd) library(grid) vcd::mosaic(Case ~ WHO_region + Vaccination, direction = c(&quot;v&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;h&quot;), zero_size = 10, highlighting_fill = c(&quot;#B9D9EB&quot;, &quot;#00008B&quot;), tidy) The mosaic plot above exhibits how dead cases and alive cases varies before and after national vaccination process starts across regions. As we can observe from the plot, EURO (Europe) and AMRO (American) accounts for major cases in the globe. Also, most importantly, vaccination do help in decreasing the death cases across regions, especially for WPRO (West Pacific, majorly East Asia) and EURO with total new death cases divided by total new cases drop by 85 percentages. However, in contrast to other regions, SEARO (South East Asia) seems to have the least improvement in death rate after vaccination but if we look at itself, its death rate also drop by 20 percentages. # Mosaic plot by vaccination and case vcd::mosaic(Case ~ Vaccination, direction = c(&quot;v&quot;, &quot;h&quot;), highlighting_fill = c(&quot;#B9D9EB&quot;, &quot;#00008B&quot;), tidy) This mosaic plot depicted on the global scale which again convinces us that the vaccination do help in decreasing death rate. Next, we aims to dig into the deeper insight on the correlation between vaccination and infected cases. As pointed out by Dr. Fauci and many specialists around the globe, the goal of the vaccine is not to prevent you from infecting Covid-19 but to prevent you from dying from this virus. Hence, we want to check is this statement true given on this three-year data. tmp2 &lt;- daily_case %&gt;% group_by(WHO_region) %&gt;% summarize( cases_bf_vac_dayrate = sum(New_cases[Date_reported &lt; START_DATE]) / length(New_cases[Date_reported &lt; START_DATE]), cases_af_vac_dayrate = sum(New_cases[Date_reported &gt;= START_DATE]) / length(New_cases[Date_reported &gt;= START_DATE]), ) # REGION(cat) | VAC(cat) | CASE(cat) | COUNT(num) tidy2 &lt;- tmp2 %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = !WHO_region, names_to = &quot;Meta&quot;, values_to = &quot;count&quot;) library(stringr) tidy2$Vaccination &lt;- ifelse(str_detect(tidy2$Meta, &quot;af_vac&quot;), &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;) tidy2 &lt;- subset(tidy2, select = -c(Meta) ) ggplot(tidy2, aes(x = WHO_region, y=count, fill = Vaccination)) + geom_col(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) #scale_fill_manual(values = icecreamcolors) Now, we use bar chart to compare the infected cases before and after vaccinations. The reason of using bar chart rather than mosaic plot is that the cases now is only for infected cases and no categorial data. Hence, we use grouped bar chart to show the distribution of infected cases before and after vaccination. The y-axis, the count, refers to the total infected cases divided by the days before or after vaccination which can then compare vaccination on the right scale. As we can tell from the bar chart, vaccination does not help in preventing infection of Covid-19. Moreover, all of the regions has doubled the infected cases after vaccination. West Pacific, mainly East Asia, has surged up tremendously which adhere to the facts that East Asia countries had much stricter rules of quarantine which accords with the low cases before vaccination. Also, after the governments relaxed the restrictions, the infected cases rised accordingly. In sum, we are convinced that the vaccination does not help in preventing from infections just like Dr. Fauci and most specialists suggested. 4.4 Dive into Vaccinations In this part, we explore the deep relationship between vaccinations and death rate. We gather the cumulative deaths and cases in each countries after their first vaccinated date. Then we merge this data with the all kinds of vaccinations percentages of each countries to determine whether some deep aspects inflect the death rate. # 1.

Finally, we use box plot to show the relationship between death rate and the number of vaccination types used in a country. ggplot(booster, aes(x = reorder(as.character(NUMBER_VACCINES_TYPES_USED), -death_rate, median), y = death_rate)) + geom_boxplot()+ xlab(&quot;number of vaccination types used&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;deaths per 1000 cases&quot;) The box plot shows that there is no significant relationship between number of vaccination types used and the death rate (Countries who uses 11 types of vaccinations even have the largest median of death rate.) "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Monthly newly reported COVID-19 cases In this part, we use D3 to create a world map that shows the newly reported COVID-19 cases per month in every country. The color scale indicates the number of newly reported cases per month. User can use the form or the buttons to select a specific month and show the result. From the plot we can clearly see how COVID-19 spread over time.At first the COVID-19 spread from China. After two months (from March 2020), the number of newly reported cases in U.S. is far more than the other countries. As time goes by, we can see that U.S., Russia, India and Brazil have the highest number of reported cases in most of the time intervals. path { stroke: white; stroke-width: 0.25px; fill: grey; } "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Conclusion 6.2 Limitations 6.3 Future directions 6.4 Lesson learns", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Conclusion Based on our exploration in the result part, we have the following findings that might be surprising to the majority. Since 2021-12, the spread of Covid-19 is almost irresistible due to the Omicron variant. No matter what policy a country adapt, the new cases reported from different WHO region stay at a relatively high level. However, it seems that the danger of this variant is reduced compared to its ancestor because the deaths reported all over the world decreased significantly in spite of the increase of new cases reported. Economically active countries and countries with large population tend to have larger infected population. This is because Covid-19 is mainly airborne and droplet-borne, first infecting the human respiratory tract. The distribution of vaccines is somewhat still unfair in each WHO region and among different regions. A lot of African countries still lack vaccines. Only a few of them have a total vaccinations more than their population. Being vaccinated cannot prevent infection because the cumulative cases do not decrease after vaccinations in each region. But vaccines do reduce the death rate in all regions significantly. The number of cases reported does not have obvious relationship to death rate. Most of the countries with large infected population have a relatively low death rate. 6.2 Limitations Due to the limitation of time and lack of related data, the result part of our final projects has the following limitations. We only explore the correlation between death rate and four detailed information about vaccinations(the ratios of vaccinations, more than one dose vaccinations, full vaccinated and booster dose), Although the result show that all of the four ratios are negatively related to the death rate, we are not sure which is the reason of the decrease of death rate. We failed to get detailed data about the type of vaccines that different countries use. We do not know which country use which type of vaccines most and least and so on. This really limits our exploration on how to best inoculate. 6.3 Future directions In the future, if possible, we will focus on the difference between different kinds of vaccines. For example, are mRNA vaccines more effective than inactivated vaccines? are people who get multiple kinds of vaccinations less likely to be infected than those who only get one kind of vaccine? 6.4 Lesson learns Use RStudio and Github to take multi-person collaboration and control version. Use R language to do exploratory data analysis and visualization. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
