Throughout these three years, COVID-19 has severely outbroken and struck the globe, paralyzed our economies and daily lives, and even transformed into different variants leading to continuing catastrophes. In this project, we are dedicated to taking advantage of different visualization tools and techniques from lectures to presenting how COVID-19 affects our globe in these years and digging into deeper insights into why the virus varies from time to time and from country to country. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard On the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard website, there are four datasets opened to be downloaded. 1.
