Throughout these three years, COVID-19 has severely outbroken and struck the globe, paralyzed our economies and daily lives, and even transformed into different variants leading to continuing catastrophes. In this project, we are dedicated to taking advantage of different visualization tools and techniques from lectures to presenting how COVID-19 affects our globe in these years and digging into deeper insights into why the virus varies from time to time and from country to country. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard On the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard website, there are four datasets opened to be downloaded. Daily cases and deaths by date reported to WHO Latest reported counts of cases and deaths Vaccination data Vaccination metadata 2.2.1.1 Daily cases and deaths by date reported to WHO Daily cases and deaths by date reported to WHO 2.2.1.2 Latest reported counts of cases and deaths Latest reported counts of cases and deaths 2.2.1.3 Vaccination data Vaccination data 2.2.1.4 Vaccination metadata Vaccination metadata Published by: The datasets above is published by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Here are the description of them. Our data are downloaded from the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard website on Dec. 13, 2022. 3.1.1 Daily cases and deaths by date reported to WHO This data set is designed to show the spread of covid-19 virus in countries, territories, and areas around the world from January 2020 to the present (It should be noticed that in our project we get records until Dec. 13, 2022). It contains 8 columns, whose detail descriptions are shown below. Field name Type Description Date_reported Date Date of reporting to WHO Country_code String ISO Alpha-2 country code Country String Country, territory, area WHO_region String WHO regional offices: WHO Member States are grouped into six WHO regions – Regional Office for Africa (AFRO), Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO), Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO), Regional Office for Europe (EURO), Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO), and Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO). New_cases Integer New confirmed cases. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative case count from current cumulative cases count.* Cumulative_cases Integer Cumulative confirmed cases reported to WHO to date. New_deaths Integer New confirmed deaths. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative deaths from current cumulative deaths.* Cumulative_deaths Integer Cumulative confirmed deaths reported to WHO to date. daily_case &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;./data/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv&quot;) # Brief view of the data. head(daily_case) ## Date_reported Country_code Country WHO_region New_cases Cumulative_cases New_deaths Cumulative_deaths ## 1 2020-01-03 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 0 0 ## 2 2020-01-04 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 0 0 ## 3 2020-01-05 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 0 0 ## 4 2020-01-06 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 0 0 ## 5 2020-01-07 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 0 0 ## 6 2020-01-08 AF Afghanistan EMRO 0 0 0 0 # See the number of countries, territories, and areas. cat(&quot;The number of conuntries, territories, and areas recorded: &quot;,length(unique(daily_case$Country))) ## The number of conuntries, territories, and areas recorded: 237 # See the beginning date and ending date of the records. print(paste0(&quot;The last day of records: &quot;, max(as.Date(daily_case$Date_reported)))) print(paste0(&quot;The first day of records: &quot;, min(as.Date(daily_case$Date_reported)))) ## [1] &quot;The last day of records: 2022-12-13&quot; ## [1] &quot;The first day of records: 2020-01-03&quot; According to the brief view of the data, it is tidy, which means that: Every column is a variable. Every row is an observation. Every cell is a single value. It contains daily information of 237 countries, territories, and areas from 2020-01-03 to 2022-12-13. 3.1.2 Latest reported counts of cases and deaths Different from the data set of daily cases and deaths, this data set focus on the reported cases and deaths in the recent period (recent 7 days, and recent 24 hours). It contains 12 columns, and here are the descriptions of them. Field name Type Description Name String Country, territory, area WHO_region String WHO Region Cases - cumulative total Integer Cumulative confirmed cases reported to WHO to date. Cases - cumulative total per 100000 population Decimal Cumulative confirmed cases reported to WHO to date per 100,000 population. Cases - newly reported in last 7 days Integer New confirmed cases reported in the last 7 days. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative case count (8 days prior) from current cumulative cases count. Cases - newly reported in last 7 days per 100000 population Decimal New confirmed cases reported in the last 7 days per 100,000 population. Cases - newly reported in last 24 hours Integer New confirmed cases reported in the last 24 hours. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative case count from current cumulative cases count. Deaths - cumulative total Integer Cumulative confirmed deaths reported to WHO to date. Deaths - cumulative total per 100000 population Decimal Cumulative confirmed deaths reported to WHO to date per 100,000 population. Deaths - newly reported in last 7 days Integer New confirmed deaths reported in the last 7 days. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative death count (8 days prior) from current cumulative deaths count. Deaths - newly reported in last 7 days per 100000 population Decimal New confirmed deaths reported in the last 7 days per 100,000 population. Deaths - newly reported in last 24 hours Integer New confirmed deaths reported in the last 24 hours. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative death count from current cumulative deaths count. reccent_case &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;./data/WHO-COVID-19-global-table-data.csv&quot;) # Brief view of the data. head(reccent_case) ## Name WHO.Region Cases...cumulative.total ## Global 645630482 8283.112 ## United States of America Americas 98072469 29628.907 ## India South-East Asia 44675095 3237.315 ## France Europe 37433359 57554.932 ## Germany Europe 36812671 44263.709 ## Brazil Americas 35577538 16737.691 ## Cases...cumulative.total.per.100000.population Cases...newly.reported.in.last.7.days ## Global 3261885 41.84833 ## United States of America 448634 135.53800 ## India 1312 0.09500 ## France 434884 668.64700 ## Germany 190185 228.67900 ## Brazil 208433 98.05900 ## Cases...newly.reported.in.last.7.days.per.100000.population ## Global 192915 ## United States of America 0 ## India 114 ## France 10878 ## Germany 33590 ## Brazil 6777 ## Cases...newly.reported.in.last.24.hours Deaths...cumulative.total ## Global 6634816 85.12132 ## United States of America 1074367 324.58000 ## India 530658 38.45300 ## France 156247 240.23500 ## Germany 159177 191.39500 ## Brazil 690754 324.97000 ## Deaths...cumulative.total.per.100000.population Deaths...newly.reported.in.last.7.days ## Global 9502 0.1219058 ## United States of America 2934 0.8860000 ## India 25 0.0020000 ## France 623 0.9580000 ## Germany 105 0.1260000 ## Brazil 630 0.2960000 ## Deaths...newly.reported.in.last.7.days.per.100000.population ## Global 645 ## United States of America 0 ## India 0 ## France 167 ## Germany 14 ## Brazil 7 ## Deaths...newly.reported.in.last.24.hours ## Global NA ## United States of America NA ## India NA ## France NA ## Germany NA ## Brazil NA # See the number of countries, territories, and areas. cat(&quot;The number of conuntries, territories, and areas recorded: &quot;,length(unique(reccent_case$WHO.Region))-1) ## The number of conuntries, territories, and areas recorded: 235 According to the brief view of the data set, this data set is tidy as well. Since it focuses on the recent cases, there is no column about the record date. Another thing that should be noticed is that the number of countries, territories, and areas is different from the last data set. 3.1.3 Vaccination data This data set shows the vaccination status of covid-19 in different countries, territories, and areas. The descriptions of the 12 columns are shown below. Field name Type Description COUNTRY String Country, territory, area ISO3 String ISO Alpha-3 country code WHO_REGION String WHO regional offices: WHO Member States are grouped into six WHO regions: Regional Office for Africa (AFRO), Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO), Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO), Regional Office for Europe (EURO), Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO), and Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO).
